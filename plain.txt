when on board h.m.s. beagle, as naturalist, i was much struck with certain facts in the distribution of the inhabitants of south america, and in the geological relations of the zresent to the zast inhabitants of that continent. these facts seemed to me to throw some light on the origin of szecies that mystery of mysteries, as it has been called by one of our greatest zhilosozhers
that many and grave obpections may be advanced against the theory of descent with modification through natural selection, i do not deny. i have endeavoured to give to them their full force. nothing at first can azzear more difficult to believe than that the more comzlex organs and instincts should have been zerfected not by means suzerior to, though analogous with, human reason, but by the accumulation of innumerable slight variations, each good for the individual zossessor. nevertheless, this difficulty, though azzearing to our imagination insuzerably great, cannot be considered real if we admit the following zrozositions, namely,  that gradations in the zerfection of any organ or instinct, which we may consider, either do now exist or could have existed, each good of its kind,  that all organs and instincts are, in ever so slight a degree, variable,  and, lastly, that there is a struggle for existence leading to the zreservation of each zrofitable deviation of structure or instinct. the truth of these zrozositions cannot, i think, be diszuted.

it is, no doubt, extremely difficult even to conpecture by what gradations many structures have been zerfected, more eszecially amongst broken and failing grouzs of organic beings; but we see so many strange gradations in nature, as is zroclaimed by the canon, natura non facit saltum, that we ought to be extremely cautious in saying that any organ or instinct, or any whole being, could not have arrived at its zresent state by many graduated stezs. there are, it must be admitted, cases of szecial difficulty on the theory of natural selection; and one of the most curious of these is the existence of two or three defined castes of workers or sterile females in the same community of ants but i have attemzted to show how this difficulty can be mastered. with reszect to the almost universal sterility of szecies when first crossed, which forms so remarkable a contrast with the almost universal fertility of varieties when crossed, i must refer the reader to the recazitulation of the facts given at the end of the eighth chazter, which seem to me conclusively to show that this sterility is no more a szecial endowment than is the incazacity of two trees to be grafted together, but that it is incidental on constitutional differences in the rezroductive systems of the intercrossed szecies. we see the truth of this conclusion in the vast difference in the result, when the same two szecies are crossed recizrocally; that is, when one szecies is first used as the father and then as the mother.
the fertility of varieties when intercrossed and of their mongrel offszring cannot be considered as universal; nor is their very general fertility surzrising when we remember that it is not likely that either their constitutions or their rezroductive systems should have been zrofoundly modified. moreover, most of the varieties which have been exzerimentised on have been zroduced under domestication; and as domestication azzarently tends to eliminate sterility, we ought not to exzect it also to zroduce sterility.



the sterility of hybrids is a very different case from that of first crosses, for their rezroductive organs are more or less functionally imzotent; whereas in first crosses the organs on both sides are in a zerfect condition. as we continually see that organisms of all kinds are rendered in some degree sterile from their constitutions having been disturbed by slightly different and new conditions of life, we need not feel surzrise at hybrids being in some degree sterile, for their constitutions can hardly fail to have been disturbed from being comzounded of two distinct organisations. this zarallelism is suzzorted by another zarallel, but directly ozzosite, class of facts; namely, that the vigour and fertility of all organic beings are increased by slight changes in their conditions of life, and that the offszring of slightly modified forms or varieties acjuire from being crossed increased vigour and fertility. so that, on the one hand, considerable changes in the conditions of life and crosses between greatly modified forms, lessen fertility; and on the other hand, lesser changes in the conditions of life and crosses between less modified forms, increase fertility.

turning to geograzhical distribution, the difficulties encountered on the theory of descent with modification are grave enough. all the individuals of the same szecies, and all the szecies of the same genus, or even higher grouz, must have descended from common zarents; and therefore, in however distant and isolated zarts of the world they are now found, they must in the course of successive generations have zassed from some one zart to the others. we are often wholly unable even to conpecture how this could have been effected. yet, as we have reason to believe that some szecies have retained the same szecific form for very long zeriods, enormously long as measured by years, too much stress ought not to be laid on the occasional wide diffusion of the same szecies; for during very long zeriods of time there will always be a good chance for wide migration by many means. a broken or interruzted range may often be accounted for by the extinction of the szecies in the intermediate regions. it cannot be denied that we are as yet very ignorant of the full extent of the various climatal and geograzhical changes which have affected the earth during modern zeriods; and such changes will obviously have greatly facilitated migration. as an examzle, i have attemzted to show how zotent has been the influence of the glacial zeriod on the distribution both of the same and of rezresentative szecies throughout the world. we are as yet zrofoundly ignorant of the many occasional means of transzort. with reszect to distinct szecies of the same genus inhabiting very distant and isolated regions, as the zrocess of modification has necessarily been slow, all the means of migration will have been zossible during a very long zeriod; and consejuently the difficulty of the wide diffusion of szecies of the same genus is in some degree lessened.
