# Genetic Algorithms
These genetic algorithm for decoding a message encrypted by permutating the alphabet, were written as an exercise in computational biology, in which I wrote and tuned a generic genetic algorithm,
a Darwin variant and a Lamarck variant. The program can run simply by clicking the executable file, upon which a GUI in which the different parameters can be set, an algorithm type selected and
when running it it will decode the message in the enc.txt file, using the dict.txt, Letter_Freq.txt and Letter2_freq.txt which needs to be in the same directory as the executable file.


All three algorithms are detailed in the report, as well as the parameters which I found to be optimal for running them on the encoded message, as well as on several other test.
